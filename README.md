# ATM Transactions Analytics
## A small data engineering & analytics project to demonstrate
data cleaning, MySQL queries, and visualization — inspired by
a real-world bank transaction dataset.

## Project Overview
Cleaned and transformed **11,000+ ATM transaction records** using Python (Pandas)
- Converted dates to proper datetime format, created **working-day flags** and **net XYZ vs Other card** feature
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into **MySQL** for SQL practice
- Performed SQL analysis:
  - Total withdrawals per ATM per month
  - Top 5 ATMs by total withdrawals
  - Average withdrawal amount per transaction
  - Weekend vs weekday withdrawal comparison
  -Visualized key insights with Python (Matplotlib & Pandas)

  ##  Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Mysql)
- MySQL / Workbench
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
## Dataset used 
  - <a href= "https://github.com/Tamang101/bank_project/blob/main/cleaned_transactions.csv">Dataset</a>
  ##  Key Insights
- Identified the busiest ATMs and withdrawal trends over the months
- Found higher withdrawal activity on weekends vs working days
- Demonstrated complete data pipeline: from CSV → cleaning → database → analysis → visualization
