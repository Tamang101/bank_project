A small data engineering & analytics project to demonstrate
data cleaning, SQL queries, and visualization — inspired by
a real-world bank transaction dataset.

 Project Overview
-Cleaned and transformed **11,000+ ATM transaction records** using Python (Pandas)
-Converted dates to proper datetime format, created **working-day flags** and **net XYZ vs Other card** feature
-Loaded the cleaned dataset into **MySQL** for SQL practice
-Performed SQL analysis:
-Total withdrawals per ATM per month
-Top 5 ATMs by total withdrawals
-Average withdrawal amount per transaction
-Weekend vs weekday withdrawal comparison
-Visualized key insights with Python (Matplotlib & Pandas)

Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy)
- MySQL / Workbench
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

Key Insights
- Identified the busiest ATMs and withdrawal trends over the months
- Found higher withdrawal activity on weekends vs working days
- Demonstrated complete data pipeline: from CSV → cleaning → database → analysis → visualization
